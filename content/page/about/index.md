Hi, Iâ€™m **Mikael Ferraz Aldebrand** â€” an electronics/software engineer passionate about building systems that blend **embedded technology, operating systems, and artificial intelligence**.

Iâ€™ve worked across different layers of the software stack, from **bare-metal firmware** up to **Linux-based systems** and **FPGA development**. My experience includes:

- **Embedded Systems**: Board Support Packages (BSP), drivers, real-time systems (RTOS), UEFI development.  
- **Operating Systems**: Custom Linux builds (Yocto), kernel-level work, system integration.  
- **Hardware/Software Co-Design**: FPGA development and low-level hardware interaction.  
- **IoT & Connectivity**: Embedded applications for IoT devices, device communication over MQTT, I2C, I2S, USB and other protocols.  
- **Applied Research**: Prototyping, evaluating new technologies, and pushing systems to their limits.  

Iâ€™m also exploring **edge AI, IoT for health & well-being, and cybersecurity monitoring tools for embedded systems** as part of my own entrepreneurial projects.  

Alongside professional work, I enjoy experimenting with **chess engines**, **low-level emulation** (Renode, QEMU), **reverse engineering** and writing about what I learn â€” which is the main purpose of this blog.

Outside of code, Iâ€™m a curious mind who enjoys learning languages, exploring new cultures, and simplifying complex ideas into accessible knowledge.  

*This page is a work-in-progress â€” Iâ€™ll be updating it as my projects and journey evolve.* ðŸš€
